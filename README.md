# TrigonometryDash-UCM-CSE165Final

Created a game similar to "Geometry Dash" in terms of gameplay. Involves having the player jump over obstacles with the jumps being in sync to the beat of the music.  This project was made with QT for CSE 165(Object Oriented Programming) at UC Merced.

Youtube video for gameplay with audio, otherwise a short gif of the game is down below. (Game isn't as laggy as the gif appears it to be. Low frame support for gifs are only avilable on read mes).
